# Workout-Tracker
This programm uses 2 different API's in order to create a google sheet that tracks your calorie burn.

First we use the Sheety API, that allows us to POST directly to a given google sheet. 
The second API is one that allows us to freely type in anything such as "I ran 3 miles" to the console and according to the
parameters you have asigned, and according to the duration it will calculate your calorie burn and upload it to the google sheet.
as you can see I have uploaded the file with all the required API Keys and APP IDs for you to actualy try ot out.
if you are interested in running this app and checking to see if it works you can see your upload in here:

ENJOY :)
